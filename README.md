This project is an exercise in creating back-end routes and functionality. With this application, the user is able to create notes with a title and body that they can save and later delete. The notes are kept within a JSON object. The back-end technology used are Express.js, Node.js, npm, and UUIDv4. The front-end HTMLs, CSS, and Javascript files were imported from a template.
